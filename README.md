The goal of this project is to provide a sdk for all platforms available with libgdx. For this, I'm using a a decompiled version of the [AppWarp Java SDK](https://github.com/shephertz/AppWarp_JAVA_SDK_JAR) and for gwt the [AppWarp JS SDK](https://github.com/shephertz/AppWarp_JS_HTML5_SDK), for which I created the bindings to the listeners and events.
